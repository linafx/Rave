The Ravencoin ecosystem is growing quickly. People all over the world are being drawn to the compelling original vision of frictionless and borderless money facilitated by on-chain scaling. The goal of RVNBOX is to build a suite of tools which help accelerate the quality and quantity of applications built on top of the $RVN platform.

### Why?

Writing a $RVN app is challenging. There is a ton of stuff to be on top of. Wallets, addresses, accounts, inputs/outputs, transactions, blocks and more. Add to that web bindings, JSON RPCs, tests, versioning and deployment and it becomes clear that a suite of tools is needed to abstract away all the common and repetitive tasks so that developers can focus on what they do best which is creating amazing applications.

### Introducing RVNBOX

We’re very happy to bring you [RVNBOX](/rvnbox)! Inspired by the great [Truffle Framework](https://truffleframework.com/) and [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache), RVNBOX consists of both a GUI and command line utility.

The GUI lets you quickly spin up your own $RVN blockchain that you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates. The command line utility lets you quickly stub out an application w/ web bindings and tests as well as a console w/ the entire $RVN RPC available.

### More coming soon

It’s our intention to help SUPERCHARGE the Ravencoin developer ecosystem and there is more being added to RVNBOX daily.
